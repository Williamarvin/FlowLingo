# FlowLingo - Multi-Language Learning Platform

## Overview

FlowLingo is a comprehensive language learning platform specializing in Chinese (Mandarin), with plans for multi-language expansion. It features multi-user authentication, secure session management, and protected learning routes. Core capabilities include progress tracking with user levels, XP, streaks, and adaptive difficulty. Key features are text generation with click-to-translate, AI-powered adaptive conversations, a voice translator with instant Mandarin-to-English translation, a universal media reader (PDF, video, audio, images), vocabulary management with spaced repetition, initial assessment testing, enhanced progressive practice sessions with mandatory retries and adaptive difficulty, an HSK-based level selection system with 50 unique topic-based levels, and a gamified sticker collection system with over 100 animated animal stickers. 

The platform uses a global XP-based level system where users earn XP from all activities (practice, conversations, text generation) to level up. Each level up awards a sticker box containing 1-3 random stickers with probability-based rarities (50% common, 30% uncommon, 13% rare, 6% epic, 1% legendary). The platform aims to provide an engaging and effective learning experience, built as a full-stack web application with a React frontend, Express backend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Updates (August 23, 2025)
- **Fixed Sticker Emoji Conflict**: Resolved issue where Flying Pegasus and Unicorn shared the same emoji, preventing users from setting pegasus as mascot. Pegasus now uses star emoji (🌟).
- **Enhanced Loot Box Animations**: Epic/legendary pulls now have special animations with doubled duration, red sparks instead of yellow, and dramatic effects.
- **Fixed Loot Box Animation**: Resolved issue where loot box animation wasn't showing on level up. Backend now properly returns sticker data when users complete levels.
- **Mascot Naming Feature**: Added ability to rename mascot on home page with inline editing, persistence to database, and toast notifications (temporarily disabled - needs db:push).
- **Voice Hover Delays**: Implemented 150ms delay for main Chinese characters and 200ms for answer choices to prevent rapid voice switching.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library

- **Middleware**: Custom logging, JSON parsing, and error handling
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracted storage interface supporting memory and database
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for core features

### Database Schema
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
- **Tables**: `users` (authentication, profiles, stats), `vocabulary_words` (spaced repetition), `conversations` (AI chat history), `generated_texts` (Chinese content), `pdf_documents` (processed PDFs), `assessment_questions`, `assessment_results`, `practice_sessions`, `achievements`, `user_achievements`.

### Authentication & Session Management
- Session-based authentication using PostgreSQL session store
- JWT-based session management
- Protected routes
- Logout functionality

### AI Integration Architecture
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4o for text generation, translation, and conversation
- **Text Generation**: Topic-based Chinese content creation with difficulty levels
- **Translation**: Character and phrase translation with pinyin support
- **Conversation**: AI-powered Mandarin conversation practice, adapting to user level
- **Speech**: Browser-based text-to-speech and speech recognition APIs
- **Progress Tracking**: XP system, level progression, streak tracking, achievement unlocking

### Enhanced Practice System
- **Mandatory Retry**: Incorrect answers must be retried until correct.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Option to drop to previous level after consecutive wrong attempts.
- **Enhanced Feedback**: Provides pinyin and meaning for answers.
- **Real-time XP Saving**: Immediate persistence of XP gains.
- **Simplified UI**: Single level progress bar.
- **Complete Pinyin Integration**: All vocabulary levels include accurate pinyin.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Color Scheme**: Vibrant green gradients (green → emerald → teal) with glass morphism effects.
- **Mascot**: "Flow" the dolphin, symbolizing intelligence and communication.
- **Gamification**: Sticker collection system (100+ animated animal stickers) earned through level progression, with rarity tiers.
- **Progression Display**: Visual HSK level progression bars integrated into the navigation sidebar.
- **TTS Speed**: Reduced text-to-speech speed (0.5) for improved clarity.
- **Sidebar UI**: Compact sidebar with prominent user stats (level, XP, streak, hearts).
